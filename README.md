**A Submission for Katy Youth Hacks 2025**

## üå≥ Inspiration & Social Good Theme

Our inspiration was to tackle a major climate challenge by creating a sustainable, market-based solution. The theme of **"social good"** is at the heart of our project. We believe the most effective way to benefit the community is to create powerful economic incentives for climate action. CarbonFlow does this by turning captured carbon, an environmental liability, into a valuable asset, empowering a circular economy where one industry's waste becomes another's raw material.

## ‚ú® What it Does

CarbonFlow is a feature-rich, full-stack application that serves as a complete ecosystem for the carbon utilization market. It connects CO‚ÇÇ producers with consumers and uses an AI-powered "consultant" to provide deep strategic analysis, rank partnership opportunities, and even model the financial and environmental impact of any potential deal.

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It

We built CarbonFlow on a modern, decoupled architecture with a **React** frontend and a **Python/Flask** backend. The core intelligence is powered by the **Azure OpenAI Service** for strategic analysis and a custom-built **Vector Engine** for intelligent partner discovery.

## üèÉ Challenges We Ran Into

Our biggest challenge was ensuring the reliability of our complex AI analysis. We re-architected our backend from a single, massive API request to multiple, smaller, and more robust requests to ensure stability. This taught us a valuable lesson in resilient system design under the pressure of a deadline.

## üöÄ What's Next for CarbonFlow

Our vision is to scale CarbonFlow into a global utility for the sustainability sector. Our next steps are to integrate real-time data feeds from sources like the EPA and build out a logistics module to analyze transportation costs and emissions.
