## 🌳 Inspiration & Social Good Theme

My inspiration was to tackle a major climate challenge by creating a sustainable, market-based solution. The theme of **"social good"** is at the heart of our project. I believe the most effective way to benefit the community is to create powerful economic incentives for climate action. CarbonFlow does this by turning captured carbon, an environmental liability, into a valuable asset, empowering a circular economy where one industry's waste becomes another's raw material.

## What it Does

CarbonFlow is a feature-rich, full-stack application that serves as a complete ecosystem for the carbon utilization market. It connects CO₂ producers with consumers and uses an AI-powered "consultant" to provide deep strategic analysis, rank partnership opportunities, and even model the financial and environmental impact of any potential deal.

## How We Built It

I built CarbonFlow on a modern, decoupled architecture with a **React** frontend and a **Python/Flask** backend. The core intelligence is powered by the **Azure OpenAI Service** for strategic analysis and a custom-built **Vector Engine** for intelligent partner discovery.

## Challenges We Ran Into

The biggest challenge was ensuring the reliability of our complex AI analysis. I re-architected our backend from a single, massive API request to multiple, smaller, and more robust requests to ensure stability. This taught me a valuable lesson in resilient system design under the pressure of a deadline.

## What's Next for CarbonFlow

My vision is to scale CarbonFlow into a global utility for the sustainability sector. The next steps are to integrate real-time data feeds from sources like the EPA and build out a logistics module to analyze transportation costs and emissions.
