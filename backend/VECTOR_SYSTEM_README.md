# Vector-Based Matching System Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the vector-based matching system for CarbonCapture Innovations Marketplace. The system transforms the basic distance-based matching into a sophisticated AI-powered recommendation engine similar to Tinder's algorithm.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Vector Engine (`vector_engine.py`)**
   - Converts producer and consumer data into vector representations
   - Manages vector persistence and caching
   - Handles vector similarity calculations

2. **Advanced Matcher (`matching_engine.py`)**
   - Combines vector similarity with traditional factors
   - Provides comprehensive match scoring and ranking
   - Generates human-readable match explanations

3. **Flask Integration (`app.py`)**
   - Enhanced API endpoints with vector data
   - Automatic vector updates on data changes
   - Fallback mechanisms for reliability

## Vector Representation

### Producer Vectors (32 dimensions)
- **Capacity tier (4D)**: One-hot encoding of supply capacity
- **Industry type (8D)**: One-hot encoding of industry classification
- **CO2 purity (1D)**: Normalized purity score
- **Geographic region (4D)**: One-hot encoding of US regions
- **Transportation methods (6D)**: Multi-hot encoding of available methods
- **Supply consistency (1D)**: Derived metric from annual/weekly capacity
- **Location embedding (8D)**: Geographic features and proximity to industrial centers

### Consumer Vectors (28 dimensions)
- **Demand tier (4D)**: One-hot encoding of demand capacity
- **Industry type (8D)**: One-hot encoding of industry classification
- **Geographic region (4D)**: One-hot encoding of US regions
- **Quality requirements (4D)**: Inferred from industry type
- **Location embedding (8D)**: Geographic features and proximity to industrial centers

## Matching Algorithm

### Scoring Components

The system uses a weighted combination of factors:

```python
final_score = (
    vector_similarity * 0.35 +      # AI-powered compatibility
    capacity_fit * 0.25 +           # Supply/demand matching
    distance_score * 0.20 +         # Geographic proximity
    quality_match * 0.15 +          # CO2 purity alignment
    transport_compatibility * 0.05  # Logistics compatibility
)
```

### Vector Similarity Calculation

Uses cosine similarity between padded vectors:
```python
similarity = dot_product / (norm_producer * norm_consumer)
```

### Quality Requirements by Industry

- **Beverage Carbonation**: 98% purity (food grade)
- **Food Processing**: 99% purity (highest grade)
- **Chemical Synthesis**: 95% purity (industrial high)
- **Concrete Curing**: 85% purity (industrial standard)
- **Vertical Farming**: 88% purity (agricultural medium)

## API Endpoints
